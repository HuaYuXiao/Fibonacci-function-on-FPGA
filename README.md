Implement this function in hardware. Assume that n is a 6-bit input and interpreted as an
unsigned integer. Note that fib(63) is 6557470319842.

1. Derive an algorithm state machine chart.

2. Sketch the conceptual diagram of the FSMD.

3. Develop the VHDL code in two-segment style.

4. Simulate the VHDL model.

5. Analyze the timing of the circuit.

6. Implement this function on the FPGA board. You may design the input/output interfaces.
